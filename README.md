# LE-3D/5s Seismometer - Acquisition System

This application creates two docker containers: one for reftek DAS130 data acquisition system, other for an EPICS IOC that consumes the files generated by DAS130.

In order to run it, docker engine and docker compose must be installed. The versions used in this application were:

```
Docker version 20.10.17, build 100c701
Docker Compose version v2.6.0
```

Once done, one can do as follows:

1. Define `.env` attributes:
```
DAS_IP=#IP where DAS130 is connected (e.g.: 10.0.38.241)
DAS_UNIT_ID= #DAS unit Identification (e.g.: B67D)
DAS_DATA_STREAM= #Unit's Data Stream providing files (e.g.: 1)
SERVER_IP=#DAS130 host server's IP (e.g.:10.0.38.86)
PV_PREFIX= #PV prefix before S-Mon: (e.g.: RR-09S:SS-Seism-Ax13:)
```

2. On the top directory of this repository, run `docker compose build`. 
3. When finished, run `docker compose up -d` 

and the IOC should be UP and running.

## Executing IOC locally:

To start IOC locally (outside container), one must install manually the pcaspy library:

`pip3 install pcaspy`

For this application, pcaspy 0.7.3. was used.

After this, one can run the following line from project's main directory:

`python3 ./scripts/main.py -p [DAS_PATH] -P [PV_PREFIX] -i [UNIT_ID] -s [DATA_STREAM]`

Where:
```
-p P        Path to DAS-130 files (e.g.: /home/reftek/bin)
-P P        Seismometer's PV prefix (e.g.: RR-09S:SS-Seism-Ax13:)
-i I        Unit ID (e.g.: B67D)
-s S        Unit's data stream to hear data (e.g.: 1)
```
